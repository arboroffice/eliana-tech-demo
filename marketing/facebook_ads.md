# 15 Facebook Ads: The 5 Awareness Stages

This document outlines 15 Facebook ad concepts categorized by Eugene Schwartz's 5 Levels of Awareness, designed to move prospects from unawareness to conversion for **ELIANATECH**.

---

## 🏗️ Stage 1: Unaware
*The prospect doesn't know they have a problem. They feel the symptoms (overwhelm, revenue plateau, chaos).*

### Ad 1: The Founder Trap
**Headline:** Is your business running you?
**Body Copy:** You started this company for freedom, but you're trapped in operations. You're the bottleneck, the firefighter, and the visionary all at once. The solution isn't "hiring a better manager." The solution is an operating system that runs without you.
**Creative:** A chaotic, cluttered calendar vs. a clean, automated dashboard.
**CTA:** See existing solution

### Ad 2: The Linear Trap
**Headline:** Why scaling feels harder, not easier.
**Body Copy:** Most companies hit a wall at $1M-$5M. Why? Because you're scaling linearly. More revenue = more people = more complexity. Break the cycle. Scale your impact, not your headcount.
**Creative:** Graph showing Revenue vs. Headcount (Linear) vs. Revenue vs. Headcount (Exponential/AI Native).
**CTA:** Learn More

### Ad 3: The Hidden Cost
**Headline:** You're overpaying for "busy work."
**Body Copy:** How many hours did your team spend on data entry, scheduling, and follow-ups this week? That's not "work"—that's inefficiency disguised as productivity. It's causing burnout and killing your margins.
**Creative:** A "receipt" showing the cost of manual tasks (e.g., "Email Follow-ups: $2,500/mo").
**CTA:** Stop the bleeding

## 📉 Stage 2: Problem Aware
*The prospect knows they have a problem (scaling is expensive, efficiency is low) but doesn't know the solution is AI Infrastructure.*

### Ad 4: The Agency Trap
**Headline:** Stop Renting Talent. Start Building Assets.
**Body Copy:** Agencies charge you retainers forever. Employees churn. But systems? Systems compound. Stop trying to solve process problems with more people. It's time to build infrastructure that you own.
**Creative:** Video contrasting an "Agency Invoice" vs. "Asset Value".
**CTA:** Build Assets

### Ad 5: Speed is Currency
**Headline:** Your competitors are faster than you.
**Body Copy:** While your team is manually qualifying leads, your competitors' AI systems are closing them. In 2026, speed isn't a luxury—it's survival. If you aren't automated, you're already behind.
**Creative:** Split screen: A slow, manual typist vs. lightning-fast code executing tasks.
**CTA:** get up to speed

### Ad 6: Profit Protection
**Headline:** Decouple Revenue from Headcount.
**Body Copy:** The old way: Grow by hiring. The new way: Grow by building. AI-native organizations scale infinitely at near-zero marginal cost. Protect your margins.
**Creative:** Animation of revenue bar going up while expense bar stays flat.
**CTA:** Learn How

## 🛠️ Stage 3: Solution Aware
*The prospect knows they need automation/AI but is considering other options (DIY, consultants, tools like ChatGPT).*

### Ad 7: No More PDFs
**Headline:** We Don't Sell Strategies. We Install Code.
**Body Copy:** Consultants give you a 50-page PDF and wish you luck. Agencies rent you hours. We do neither. We install the actual technical infrastructure that runs your business for you. Don't pay for advice. Pay for execution.
**Creative:** A hand throwing a "Strategy Document" in the trash and turning on a "Server".
**CTA:** See what we build

### Ad 8: Beyond Chatbots
**Headline:** ChatGPT isn't a strategy.
**Body Copy:** Signing up for AI tools is easy. Integrating them into a seamless, autonomous workflow that replaces entire departments is hard. That's the difference between "using AI" and being "AI-Native."
**Creative:** A mess of disconnected logos (Zapier, OpenAI, Slack) organizing into a sleek circuit board.
**CTA:** Get Integrated

### Ad 9: Don't DIY
**Headline:** You wouldn't build your own CRM.
**Body Copy:** So why are you trying to hack together your own AI operations? You need enterprise-grade architecture, not a fragile web of Zaps. Get professional growth infrastructure installed for you.
**Creative:** Side-by-side: "Duct Tape Solution" vs. "Engineered System".
**CTA:** Get Professional Help

---

## 🚀 Stage 4: Product Aware
*The prospect knows ELIANATECH / The Offer, but needs to be convinced why YOU are the right specific choice.*

### Ad 10: Your Fractional CAIO
**Headline:** The C-Suite Executive You Can't Hire.
**Body Copy:** Get the strategic vision of a Chief AI Officer combined with the execution power of a dev team. We identify the opportunities AND build the systems to capture them. It's a partnership, not a vendor relationship.
**Creative:** Photo of the "Inner Circle" or a professional team meeting vibe.
**CTA:** meet your team

### Ad 11: Enterprise Value
**Headline:** Build a business you can sell.
**Body Copy:** Buyers pay for systems, not hustle. We transform your operations from "founder-dependent" to "autonomous." Increase your multiple by building tangible IP and infrastructure.
**Creative:** A "For Sale" sign on a business with a "Sold - Premium" sticker.
**CTA:** Increase Value

### Ad 12: Proven Tech
**Headline:** Proven Across Industries.
**Body Copy:** From Construction to SaaS, Real Estate to Healthcare. Our Growth Infrastructure works because it solves the universal bottleneck: human inefficiency. See how we've helped companies like yours.
**Creative:** Carousel of logos/case studies from different industries.
**CTA:** View Case Studies

## 🎯 Stage 5: Most Aware
*The prospect is ready to buy but needs a nudge (urgency, direct offer).*

### Ad 13: The Audit
**Headline:** Where are you bleeding money?
**Body Copy:** Book your AI Infrastructure Audit. We'll tear down your operations and show you exactly where manual work is killing your growth—and how to automate it in 90 days.
**Creative:** A "Red Pen" marking up a process flowchart.
**CTA:** Book Audit

### Ad 14: Limited Intake
**Headline:** Q1 Infrastructure Builds closing soon.
**Body Copy:** We only partner with 3 new organizations per month for full infrastructure installation to ensure quality. Secure your spot for this quarter and start scaling.
**Creative:** Simple text graphic: "3 Spots Left for March".
**CTA:** Apply Now

### Ad 15: Direct Invitation
**Headline:** Ready to become AI-Native?
**Body Copy:** If you're generating $1M+ and feel the drag of manual ops, let's talk. We'll show you how to automate 50% of your workload and 10x your capacity. No fluff, just code.
**Creative:** Founder (Mia) speaking directly to camera / professional shot.
**CTA:** Schedule Call
