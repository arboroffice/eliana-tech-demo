## Challenge

Serenity Suites offered high-end treatments but suffered from common industry plagues: last-minute cancellations and empty slots during workdays. Their receptionists spent hours playing phone tag to reschedule clients, taking time away from in-person guest service.

## Solution

We deployed an intelligent Booking & Concierge Agent.

*   **Smart Reminders & Confirmations:** Engaged clients via SMS/WhatsApp with easy rescheduling options, reducing no-shows.
*   **Waitlist Management:** Automatically notified waitlisted clients when a slot opened up, filling gaps instantly.
*   **Dynamic Yield Management:** Offered targeted incentives to loyal clients to book during typically slow periods, maximizing staff utilization.
