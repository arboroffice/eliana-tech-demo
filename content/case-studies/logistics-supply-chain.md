## Challenge

GlobalTrans managed complex international supply chains where a delay in one port could cascade into weeks of downtime. They reacted to disruptions after they happened, leading to expensive expedited shipping fees and angry clients.

## Solution

We built a Supply Chain Digital Twin.

*   **Disruption Sensing:** AI monitored news, weather, and port congestion data to predict potential delays days in advance.
*   **Scenario Planning:** Simulated thousands of rerouting options to recommend the most cost-effective alternative during a crisis.
*   **Warehouse Optimization:** Predicted inventory arrival times to optimize staffing and shelf space at distribution centers.
