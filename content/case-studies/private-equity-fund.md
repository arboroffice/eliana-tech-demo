## Challenge

Apex Capital was competing with dozens of other firms for the same auctioned companies, driving up valuations and reducing returns. They needed a way to find "off-market" founders willing to sell before an investment bank got involved.

## Solution

We built a Proprietary Deal Sourcing Engine.

*   **Signal Monitoring:** Tracked non-obvious signals like hiring spikes, patent filings, or social sentiment changes that indicated a company was ripe for investment.
*   **Automated Outreach:** Sent hyper-personalized cold emails to founders referencing specific achievements found by the AI, generating high response rates.
*   **Competitor Mapping:** Automatically generated competitive landscapes for potential targets to speed up the investment committee's review.
