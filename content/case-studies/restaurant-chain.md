## Challenge

FreshBites operates 50 locations and struggled with the classic restaurant dilemma: balancing fresh inventory with fluctuating demand. Over-ordering led to waste, while under-ordering caused lost sales. Additionally, static menu strategy didn't account for ingredient cost volatility.

## Solution

We implemented an AI-driven operations platform.

*   **Demand Forecasting:** Analyzed local events, weather, and historical data to predict daily sales with 95% accuracy.
*   **Dynamic Inventory Ordering:** Automated supplier orders to align perfectly with predicted consumption.
*   **Yield Optimization:** Suggested minor menu optimizations based on real-time ingredient availability to maintain healthy margins without impacting customer loyalty.
