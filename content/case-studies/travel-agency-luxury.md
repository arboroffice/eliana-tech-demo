## Challenge

Ethereal Journeys catered to ultra-high-net-worth individuals. Planning a 3-week multi-continent trip involved checking hundreds of flights, hotels, and transfer options manually. One mistake could ruin a high-value vacation.

## Solution

We built a Luxury Travel AI Assistant.

*   **Dynamic Itinerary Builder:** Instantly generated complex route options optimizing for flight times, layovers, and transfer logistics.
*   **Live Availability Sync:** Connected directly to hotel and tour operator APIs to ensure every suggested activity was actually bookable.
*   **Personalization Engine:** Automatically flagged potential issues based on client preferences (e.g., "This hotel doesn't have a gym, and the client is a fitness enthusiast").
