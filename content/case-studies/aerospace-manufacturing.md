## Challenge

AeroTech manufactured turbine blades where even a microscopic defect could be catastrophic. Human inspectors fatigued after hours of staring at parts under microscopes, leading to missed defects and inconsistent quality standards.

## Solution

We deployed a Computer Vision Inspection System.

*   **Automated Optical Inspection (AOI):** High-res cameras combined with deep learning models identified anomalies across 50 different defect types.
*   **Real-time Feedback:** Alerted machine operators instantly when defect rates spiked, allowing them to adjust tooling before producing a batch of scrap.
*   **Traceability:** Archived images of every single part produced, creating a complete digital thread for safety audits.
