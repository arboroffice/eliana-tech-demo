## Challenge

Peak Performance Agency hit a ceiling. They couldn't onboard new clients because their writing team was maxed out. Hiring quality copywriters was slow and expensive, and maintaining consistent brand voice across 50 clients was becoming a nightmare.

## Solution

We built a custom Generative Content Pipeline.

*   **Brand Voice Cloning:** Trained models on each client's existing content to perfectly mimic their unique tone and style.
*   **SEO-First Generation:** Integrated real-time keyword data to ensure every piece was optimized for current search trends.
*   **Multi-Format Repurposing:** Automatically converted blog posts into social captions, email newsletters, and video scripts, maximizing the value of every idea.
