## Challenge

LearnVault had thousands of monthly subscribers across multiple course libraries. Churn was 11% per month — members would go quiet for a few weeks, then cancel. The team tried manual outreach but couldn't scale it. By the time they noticed a member was disengaged, it was usually too late.

## Solution

We deployed an AI-powered Churn Prevention Engine.

*   **Engagement Scoring:** The AI scored every member daily based on login frequency, course progress, community participation, and support interactions — flagging at-risk members 2-3 weeks before typical cancellation.
*   **Automated Re-Engagement:** At-risk members received personalized sequences: new content recommendations, progress reminders, and exclusive offers — all triggered automatically.
*   **Win-Back Campaigns:** Cancelled members entered a 60-day win-back sequence with personalized messaging based on their usage history and stated reasons for leaving.
