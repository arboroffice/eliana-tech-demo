## Challenge

SonicWaves Festival struggled with massive crowds. Long lines at entry gates and food stalls led to unhappy attendees and safety risks. They had no way to know where a bottleneck was forming until it was too late.

## Solution

We implemented a Real-Time Crowd Management System.

*   **Density Monitoring:** Used anonymized WiFi signal data and camera feeds to create a heatmap of attendee density across the grounds.
*   **Predictive Queueing:** Alerted operations teams 15 minutes before a line was predicted to become unmanageable so they could open more lanes.
*   **Dynamic Signage:** Automatically updated digital signs to direct foot traffic to less busy food courts or bathrooms.
