## Challenge

Miller Farms faced tightening margins due to rising input costs and unpredictable weather patterns. Blanket spraying and watering fields was wasteful and expensive. They needed a way to treat every plant individually at scale.

## Solution

We deployed a Precision Ag Platform using drone and satellite data.

*   **Crop Health Monitoring:** Multispectral cameras identified stressed plants days before the human eye could see yellowing leaves.
*   **Variable Rate Application:** Generated prescription maps for tractors to spray fertilizer only where needed, rather than the whole field.
*   **Micro-Climate Weather:** Used local IoT sensors to predict frost events or rainfall for specific fields, allowing for timely protective measures.
