## Challenge

DeepSea Energy operated remote offshore rigs where spare parts were weeks away. Equipment failures were reactive, leading to massive production losses and safety risks while waiting for repairs.

## Solution

We implemented an IoT Predictive Maintenance Suite.

*   **Vibration Analysis:** Sensors monitored pumps and drills for subtle vibration changes indicating bearing wear.
*   **Failure Prediction Models:** AI compared real-time sensor data against historical failure signatures to predict breakdowns 2-3 weeks out.
*   **Automated Logistics:** The system automatically triggered spare part orders when a high probability of failure was detected, ensuring parts arrived before the machine broke.
