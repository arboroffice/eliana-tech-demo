## Challenge

CloudDash Pro had a powerful analytics product, but onboarding was entirely manual. Every new customer got a 45-minute setup call, a series of follow-up emails, and a check-in call at day 14. With 30+ new signups per week, the team was spending more time onboarding than building product. Worse, users who didn't get a call within 48 hours often churned before ever seeing value.

## Solution

We implemented an AI-powered Automated Onboarding System.

*   **Behavior-Driven Sequences:** AI tracked each user's actions and triggered personalized guidance based on where they were in the product — not on a fixed schedule.
*   **Smart Milestone Detection:** The system identified when users hit key activation milestones and celebrated progress, or intervened when they stalled.
*   **Intelligent Escalation:** Users showing signs of confusion or frustration were automatically flagged for a human touchpoint, with full context passed to the success team.
