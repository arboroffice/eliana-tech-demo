## Challenge

Wu & Associates was buried in receipts. During tax season, staff worked 80-hour weeks just keying in data from shoeboxes of client documents. Burnout was high, and they had zero time to offer the strategic advice their clients were asking for.

## Solution

We implemented an Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) system.

*   **Receipt Extraction:** AI automatically extracted vendor, date, total, and tax form receipts with 99.9% accuracy.
*   **Auto-Categorization:** The system learned how the firm categorized expenses (e.g., "Meals" vs. "Client Entertainment") and applied codes automatically.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Flagged duplicates or suspicious expenses for human review, catching potential errors before the tax return was filed.
