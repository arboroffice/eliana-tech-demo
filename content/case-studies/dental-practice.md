## Challenge

Missed calls during lunch hours and weekends meant lost patients. Emergency triage relied solely on an answering service that couldn't schedule appointments.

## Solution

An AI Voice and Chat receptionist was integrated to answer calls, screen for dental emergencies (pain, swelling), and book immediate slots or routine checkups directly into the practice management software.
