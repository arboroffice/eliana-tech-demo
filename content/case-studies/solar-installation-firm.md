## Challenge

SunPower Systems wasted thousands of dollars sending sales reps to homes that had too much shade or poor roof angles. Their manual proposal process took days, allowing competitors to swoop in. They needed a way to qualify technical feasibility instantly.

## Solution

We developed a Remote Solar Assessment Tool.

*   **Computer Vision Analysis:** Analyzed satellite data to calculate roof surface area, azimuth, and shade obstacles automatically.
*   **Yield Modeling:** Integrated local weather data to predict accurate energy generation and financial ROI for the homeowner.
*   **Instant Proposals:** Generated a dynamic web proposal for the homeowner seconds after they submitted their address, locking them in while interest was high.
