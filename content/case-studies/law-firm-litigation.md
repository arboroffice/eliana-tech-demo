## Challenge

In a massive class-action lawsuit, Davis & Associates had to review 2 million emails and documents. Using human reviewers would have represented a massive financial burden and taken months, jeopardizing the trial timeline.

## Solution

We implemented an AI-Powered E-Discovery Platform.

*   **Semantic Search:** Instead of keyword matching, the AI understood concepts (e.g., finding evidence of "hiding assets" even if those words weren't used).
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Flagged emails with unusually high stress or aggressive language as potential hotpots for investigation.
*   **Relationship Mapping:** Visualized communication patterns to identify key influencers and hidden connections between custodians.
