## Challenge

CoolAir Pros had 50 vans servicing the metro area, but dispatch was handled manually. Inefficient routing meant technicians crisscrossed the city, wasting fuel and arriving late to appointments. Emergency calls threw the whole schedule into chaos.

## Solution

We implemented an AI-powered Fleet Dispatch System.

*   **Dynamic Route Optimization:** Algorithms recalculated routes in real-time based on traffic, job duration, and technician location.
*   **Predictive Maintenance:** Analyzed vehicle telematics to schedule van maintenance before breakdowns occurred.
*   **Intelligent Dispatching:** Automatically assigned the nearest qualified technician to emergency calls with minimal disruption to the existing schedule.
