## Challenge

Velvet & Vine, a high-end fashion retailer, was struggling to replicate their premium in-store experience on their digital channels. Customers were overwhelmed by the catalog and abandoning carts at a high rate. They needed a way to offer personalized guidance at scale without hiring hundreds of new support agents.

Key challenges included:
*   High cart abandonment rates due to decision fatigue.
*   Lack of personalized product discovery.
*   Disjointed customer data across online and offline channels.

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive AI personal shopping assistant integrated into their website and mobile app.

*   **Visual Preference Learning:** The AI analyzed user browsing behavior to understand style preferences and suggest complete outfits.
*   **Predictive Inventory:** Used purchasing trends to forecast demand and optimize stock levels for seasonal collections.
*   **Unified Customer Profiles:** aggregrated data to provide store associates with insights for better in-person service.

The result was a seamless, high-touch shopping experience that felt bespoke to every customer, significantly boosting loyalty and sales.
