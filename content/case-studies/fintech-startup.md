## Challenge

NovaBank was growing virally but hit a wall with manual compliance checks. Their backlog of unverified accounts was growing by thousands daily, leading to massive churn as users gave up waiting for approval.

## Solution

We integrated an enterprise-grade AI Compliance Engine.

*   **Automated Document Verification:** Used computer vision to authenticate IDs and passports instantly.
*   **Behavioral Fraud Detection:** Analyzed signup patterns to flag bot networks and suspicious actors before they entered the system.
*   **Regulatory Adaptation:** The system automatically updated its rules engine as financial regulations changed across different jurisdictions they operated in.
