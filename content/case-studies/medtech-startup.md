## Challenge

A rapidly growing health-tech startup faced a 300% surge in support tickets. They needed to provide round-the-clock triage without hiring a massive overseas support center.

## Solution

We built a custom AI support agent capable of handling Level 1 and Level 2 queries, including technical troubleshooting and account management. Complex medical issues are smartly escalated to human experts.
