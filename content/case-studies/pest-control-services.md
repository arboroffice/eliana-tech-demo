## Challenge

BugBusters had thousands of recurring quarterly appointments. Scheduling them manually resulted in "spaghetti routes" where technicians drove across town between stops, wasting time and fuel. Rescheduling missed appointments was a logistical headache.

## Solution

We deployed an AI Route Density Optimizer.

*   **Cluster-Based Scheduling:** The AI grouped appointments geographically, offering customers slots when a technician was already in their neighborhood.
*   **Automated Outreach:** Sent SMS reminders and allowed customers to confirm or reschedule via text without calling the office.
*   **Weather Adaptation:** Automatically rescheduled exterior treatments when rain was forecast, preventing wasted trips.
