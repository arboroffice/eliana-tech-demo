## Challenge

LearnFast offered great video courses, but students often got stuck on specific concepts. Without immediate help, they would get frustrated and drop out. Hiring enough human tutors to cover all time zones and subjects was financially impossible.

## Solution

We integrated an AI Tutor Assistant into their learning management system.

*   **Socratic Contextual Help:** The AI didn't just give answers; it guided students to the solution using Socratic questioning, reinforcing learning.
*   **Curriculum Mapping:** The AI understood the exact syllabus and could reference specific video timestamps or reading materials.
*   **Progress Monitoring:** Identified struggling students early based on their questions and quiz performance, alerting human counselors to intervene.
