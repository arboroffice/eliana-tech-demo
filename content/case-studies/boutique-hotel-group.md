## Challenge

The Grandeur wanted to differentiate itself from big chains by offering unmatched personal service. However, manually tracking the preferences of thousands of guests—allergies, pillow types, drink choices—in a way that staff could actually use was impossible.

## Solution

We implemented a Guest Experience Engine.

*   **Preference Aggregation:** Scraped data from booking notes, past stay history, and even public social media (where compliant) to build rich guest profiles.
*   **Actionable Insights:** Daily reports for housekeeping and kitchen staff (e.g., "Room 304 loves dark chocolate," "Room 201 is allergic to feathers").
*   **Pre-Arrival Concierge:** An AI agent reached out before arrival to curate the stay, effectively upselling spa treatments and dinner reservations tailored to the guest's taste.
