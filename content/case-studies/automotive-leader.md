## Challenge

The dealership was missing 70% of inbound inquiries that came in after hours. Potential buyers were browsing in the evenings but receiving no immediate response, leading them to competitor sites.

## Solution

We deployed 'Michael', an AI Sales Agent trained on their specific inventory and financing options. Michael engages visitors 24/7, answers questions about specific models, and books test drives directly into the sales CRM.
