## Challenge

Agents were overwhelmed by repetitive questions about property details and scheduling viewings, spending 15+ hours a week on administrative tasks instead of closing deals.

## Solution

Eliana Tech implemented a centralized AI receptionist that handles all property inquiries across Zillow, website, and SMS. It pre-screens tenants/buyers and automatically schedules viewings based on agent availability.
