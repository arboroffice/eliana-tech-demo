## The Death of the Cookie

As third-party cookies die, generic ad retargeting is losing effectiveness. Brands need a new way to engage customers—personally and directly.

## What is AI Clienteling?

It's a proactive, conversational agent that acts as a personal stylist or shopper.
*   **The Follow-up**: "Hi Sarah, how are those running shoes fitting? We just got a matching jacket in stock."
*   **The Consultation**: "I see you're looking for a gift for your husband. What's his style?" -> *AI generates 3 curated options.*
