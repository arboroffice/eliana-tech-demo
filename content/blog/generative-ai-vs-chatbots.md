## The "I didn't understand that" Loop

Old chatbots were "Decision Trees". A human programmer had to map out every possible sentence a user might say.
*   User says "Billing" -> Bot goes to Billing branch.
*   User says "I want to pay an invoice" -> Bot crashes because it only knew "Billing".

## The Generative Revolution

Generative AI (LLMs) doesn't use decision trees. It understands language like a human does. It understands **Context** and **Intent**.

*   **Old Bot**: rigid, frustrating, limited to ~50 programmed paths.
*   **GenAI Bot**: fluid, empathetic, unlimited vocabulary, can handle complex, multi-sentence requests.

## Why it Matters for Customer Service

If your customer feels like they are talking to a robot, they hang up. If they feel like they are talking to a helpful assistant, they buy. The "Uncanny Valley" has been bridged. We are now in the age of conversational commerce.
