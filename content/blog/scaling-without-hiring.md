## The Staffing Trap

Aggressive revenue growth is usually the hardest phase for a business. You need more capacity, so you hire. But hiring is expensive, and new hires take months to become profitable. Your margins compress, and you work harder for less profit.

## The Automated Enterprise

The most profitable companies of the 2020s are "Automated Enterprises". They use AI to decouple revenue from headcount.

### 3 Pillars of the Automated Enterprise

1.  **Marketing Automation**: AI generates content, manages ads, and captures leads.
2.  **Sales Automation**: AI qualifies leads, books meetings, and follows up (forever).
3.  **Service Automation**: AI handles support tickets, onboarding, and reporting.

By automating these execution layers, you only hire for **Strategy** and **Management**. You keep your team small, your culture tight, and your margins huge.
