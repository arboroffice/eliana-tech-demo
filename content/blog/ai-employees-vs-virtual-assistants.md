## The reliable alternative to outsourcing

For years, the standard advice for scaling a small business was "hire a Virtual Assistant (VA)." Usually offshore, usually affordable. But anyone who has managed a team of VAs knows the hidden costs: training, turnover, time zone lags, and quality control.

Enter the AI Employee.

## Cost Comparison

| Resource | Human VA (Offshore) | AI Employee (Eliana Tech) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ongoing Investment** | Standard wages | Fraction of the investment |
| **Training Time** | 2-4 Weeks | Instant (Pre-trained) |
| **Availability** | 40 hours / week | 168 hours / week (24/7) |
| **Management Overhead** | High (Daily check-ins) | Zero (Set and forget) |

## The Efficiency Gap

A human VA can handle one task at a time. If they are on the phone, they aren't answering emails. An AI Employee is infinitely scalable. It can hold 50 simultaneous phone conversations while replying to 100 emails and updating your CRM—all in the same second.

## Valid Use Cases for Humans

We aren't saying humans are obsolete. Humans are needed for:
*   High-level creative strategy.
*   Complex emotional negotiation.
*   Physical world tasks.

For everything else—scheduling, data entry, initial outreach, FAQ support—AI is simply the superior economic choice.
