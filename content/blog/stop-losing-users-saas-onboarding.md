## The Silent Revenue Leak

If you run a SaaS company, you know the problem. Someone signs up for your product. They log in once. Maybe twice. Then they disappear.

**That user was worth thousands in lifetime value.**

They don't send a complaint. They don't ask for help. They just... leave. And you find out 30 days later when the trial expires or the card doesn't renew.

## How AI-Powered Onboarding Changes the Game

AI-powered onboarding isn't a welcome email. It's an intelligent system that guides every user to first value — automatically, personally, 24/7. It can:
1.  **Detect Where Users Get Stuck**: Behavioral signals show exactly where users drop off.
2.  **Adapt in Real-Time**: Different users get different guidance based on their actions.
3.  **Trigger the Right Nudge**: "You're 2 steps away from your first dashboard. Here's a 60-second walkthrough."

## Case Study: The B2B SaaS Platform

We worked with a B2B SaaS company losing 65% of trial users before they ever activated. By deploying automated onboarding:
*   **Activation Rate Doubled**: From 18% to 38% in the first 60 days.
*   **Significant New ARR**: Trial-to-paid conversions jumped, adding $12K MRR in month one.
*   **Team Freedom**: The founder stopped doing 1-on-1 onboarding calls for every new signup.

Stop letting users slip away just because they didn't figure out your product on their own.
