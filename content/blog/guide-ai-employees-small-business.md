## What is an AI Employee?

An AI Employee is not just a chatbot. It's an intelligent agent capable of performing complex, multi-step tasks that traditionally required human intervention. Unlike a simple "if-this-then-that" script, an AI Employee can reason, make decisions within set parameters, and learn from interactions.

## The Difference: Chatbot vs. AI Employee

| Feature | Legacy Chatbot | AI Employee |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic** | Fixed Decision Tree | Generative & Adaptive |
| **Memory** | Session-based (forgets you instantly) | Long-term Context (remembers preferences) |
| **Action** | Can only send links | Can book meetings, update CRMs, send emails |
| **Scope** | FAQ Answering | End-to-End Job Execution |

## Why Small Businesses Are Adopting This Now

The cost of intelligence has dropped by 99% in the last 18 months. What used to require a multi-six-figure enterprise investment to build can now be deployed for a fraction of the investment of a minimum wage employee.

### Key Benefits

1.  **24/7 Availability**: Missed calls are missed revenue. AI never sleeps.
2.  **Instant Scalability**: Need to handle 100 calls at once during a promo? No problem.
3.  **Consistency**: Every customer gets the perfect script, every time.

## How to Get Started

Start small. Identify the one task that takes up the most "brain space" but requires the least "creative judgment". For most, this is scheduling or initial lead qualification.
