## The Hygiene Recall Struggle

Every dentist knows the gold is in the patient database. But manual recall—calling people 6 months after their cleaning—is tedious. Receptionists avoid it, or leave voicemail messages that are never returned.

## Reactivation Campaigns with AI

We deployed an AI agent to a practice with 2,000 dormant patients.
1.  **SMS Outreach**: "Hi Sarah, Dr. Smith here. It's been 8 months since your last cleaning. We have a slot this Tuesday at 10 AM, want it?"
2.  **Conversational Booking**: Sarah replies, "Tuesday no good, how about Friday?" The AI checks the PMS and books it.
3.  **Result**: Significant revenue in booked hygiene appointments in 48 hours.

## Phone Handling

When the front desk is busy checking out a patient, the phone rings. Instead of a busy signal or voicemail hell, the AI answers. It handles the "Are you open?" and "Do you take Delta Dental?" calls, so your staff can focus on the patient standing in front of them.
