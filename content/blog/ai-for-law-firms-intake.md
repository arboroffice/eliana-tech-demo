## The Intake Bottleneck

Your intake process defines your firm's growth. If it's slow, potential clients move on. If it's sloppy, you waste hours consulting with unqualified leads who can't afford your retainer or don't fit your practice area.

## Automating the Triage

AI agents are perfect for the rigid, logic-based nature of legal intake.
*   **Family Law**: "Are there children involved? Is there a current court order?"
*   **Personal Injury**: "When did the accident happen? Was there a police report?"
*   **Criminal Defense**: "What is the charge? When is the court date?"

## Ethical Considerations

Is it ethical? Yes, provided it is disclosed.
1.  **Transparency**: The agent identifies itself as an AI assistant.
2.  **Data Security**: All conversations are encrypted and HIPAA/GDPR compliant.
3.  **No Legal Advice**: The AI is programmed with strict guardrails to *never* offer legal advice, only to gather facts and schedule time with an attorney.

## The Result

Attorneys spend their time being attorneys, not call center agents. Clients feel heard instantly, even at 2 AM on a Saturday when their legal emergency strikes.
