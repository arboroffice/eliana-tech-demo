You built a business. But somewhere along the way, the business started running you. Every decision flows through you. Every problem lands on your desk. Every vacation comes with a phone that won't stop buzzing.

The problem isn't your team. It's your **systems** — or rather, the lack of them. **Business systems design** is the discipline of building operations that function without the owner being the operating system.

This framework will show you how to design, build, and implement systems that let your business run — and let you lead instead of manage.

## What Is Business Systems Design?

Business systems design is the process of creating repeatable, documented, and (increasingly) automated processes for every function in your business.

A well-designed system answers these questions:
- **What happens?** (The process)
- **Who does it?** (The role)
- **When does it happen?** (The trigger)
- **How is it done?** (The steps)
- **What does good look like?** (The standard)
- **What happens when it breaks?** (The escalation)

When you have systems for everything, the business doesn't depend on any single person — including you.

## The Systems Design Framework

### Level 1: Document

You can't improve what you can't see. The first level is making every process visible.

**For each function in your business, document:**

1. **Process name** — What is this?
2. **Purpose** — Why does this exist?
3. **Trigger** — What starts this process?
4. **Steps** — Every action, in order
5. **Owner** — Who's responsible?
6. **Inputs** — What information/materials are needed?
7. **Outputs** — What's the deliverable?
8. **Tools** — What software/resources are used?
9. **Standards** — What does "done well" look like?
10. **Exceptions** — What do you do when the normal process doesn't apply?

**Pro tip:** Don't write these in a vacuum. Watch the person who does the job and document what they actually do — not what you think they do. You'll be surprised.

### Level 2: Standardize

Once documented, look for inconsistencies and optimize:

- **Remove unnecessary steps** — If a step doesn't add value, cut it
- **Standardize tools** — Everyone should use the same tools the same way
- **Create templates** — Recurring outputs should have templates
- **Define quality standards** — Objective criteria, not subjective judgment
- **Build checklists** — For complex processes, checklists prevent missed steps

### Level 3: Delegate

With documented, standardized processes, you can delegate confidently:

- **Clear ownership** — One person owns each process
- **Training materials** — New people can learn from documentation
- **Quality checks** — Built-in review points ensure standards are met
- **Escalation paths** — Everyone knows when and how to escalate

### Level 4: Automate

This is where AI enters. With processes documented, standardized, and delegated, you can identify which ones AI should handle:

- **Fully automate** — AI handles end-to-end without human involvement
- **AI-assisted** — AI does the heavy lifting, human reviews
- **AI-monitored** — Humans do the work, AI tracks quality and flags issues
- **Human only** — Some processes stay fully manual (strategy, relationships, creativity)

## The Systems Design Process

### Week 1-2: Audit
Map every process in your business across all 8 systems. Don't overthink it — a simple list with time estimates and owners is enough to start.

### Week 3-4: Prioritize
Rank processes by:
- Time consumed (highest first)
- Impact on revenue/client experience (highest first)
- Automation potential (highest first)

### Month 2: Document Top 10
Take your top 10 processes and create full documentation. Include screenshots, videos, and step-by-step instructions.

### Month 2-3: Standardize & Automate
For each documented process:
- Eliminate waste
- Create templates
- Identify AI automation opportunities
- Build the first automations

### Month 3-6: Expand
Document and automate the next tier of processes. Build connections between systems. Train your team on the new way of working.

### Month 6-12: Optimize
Review system performance. Measure time saved, quality improved, and revenue impact. Refine and expand.

## The Owner Freedom Test

Here's how to know if your systems are working:

**Can you take two weeks off without:**
- Answering work calls or emails?
- Making any operational decisions?
- Worrying about quality?
- Coming back to a disaster?

If yes, your systems work. If no, you know what to build next.

Most owners can't pass this test. But it's not because they have bad teams — it's because they haven't built the systems that would let their teams operate independently.

## Why AI Makes This Possible Now

Business systems design has always been important. But before AI, the "automate" level was limited to simple rule-based workflows. Now:

- AI handles complex decisions that used to require human judgment
- AI generates content, reports, and communications
- AI monitors quality and flags issues proactively
- AI learns and improves over time
- AI costs a fraction of what human labor costs

This means you can build systems with a level of sophistication that was previously only available to companies with large operations teams. The playing field has been leveled.
