## The Guest Experience Paradox

Guests want instant service, but hotels are struggling to hire enough staff to man the front desk 24/7. The result? Long hold times, frustrated travelers, and negative TripAdvisor reviews.

## Enter the AI Concierge

Imagine a guest texts or calls the front desk:
*   "Can I get extra towels?" -> **AI dispatches housekeeping request.**
*   "What time is checkout?" -> **AI answers instantly.**
*   "Book me a table at the steakhouse." -> **AI checks OpenTable integration and confirms.**

## It's Not About Replacing Humans

It's about freeing them. When the phone stops ringing off the hook with "what is the wifi password?", your front desk staff can actually look guests in the eye, smile, and provide the high-touch hospitality that earns 5 stars.

## Implementation is Easy

Eliana Tech integrates with major PMS (Property Management Systems). We can ingest your entire guest directory and local guide in minutes, training a concierge that knows your hotel better than your newest hire.
