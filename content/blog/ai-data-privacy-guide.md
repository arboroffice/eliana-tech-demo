## The Fear: "Will ChatGPT leak my secrets?"

We've all heard the stories. Employees pasting sensitive code into public chatbots. It's a valid concern. If you use free, public AI tools, you are the product. Your data trains their models.

## Enterprise-Grade AI is Different

Eliana Tech builds on **Enterprise APIs**, not public interfaces.
1.  **Zero Retention**: Our data agreement with providers like Google and OpenAI ensures your data is *not* used to train their base models.
2.  **Encryption**: Data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
3.  **Isolation**: Your knowledge base is your own. We use RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to let the AI "read" your documents temporarily to answer a question, without "learning" them permanently into its brain.

## Staying Compliant

Whether you are in healthcare (HIPAA), finance (SOC2), or Europe (GDPR), dedicated AI infrastructure is the only way to remain compliant. Don't ban AI; secure it.
