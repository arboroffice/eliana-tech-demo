## The Leaky Pipeline

In early-stage startups, leads fall through the cracks constantly.
*   The customized demo request sits for 3 days.
*   The "hot lead" isn't followed up on after the trial expires.
*   Attribution data is lost, so you don't know which ads are working.

## AI as your RevOps Manager

You can't afford a high-level RevOps director yet. But you can afford an AI Agent that orchestrates your CRM.
1.  **Instant Enrichment**: A lead comes in. AI searches LinkedIn and Clearbit, adding company size and role to the CRM.
2.  **Smart Routing**: High-value enterprise leads go to the Founder. Small leads go to the automated nurture sequence.
3.  **Pipeline Policing**: AI pings your sales rep: "You haven't emailed Acme Corp in 7 days. Draft email is ready, click to send."

## Data-Driven Growth

When your data is clean and your process is automated, you can finally trust your dashboard. You know exactly what your CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) is, and where to double down.
