## The Million Dollar Leak

If you run a home service business, you know the drill. You're under a sink or on a roof. Your phone rings. You can't answer it.

**That call was worth a significant contract.**

The customer doesn't leave a voicemail. They call the next plumber on Google. Speed to lead isn't just a metric; it's survival.

## How AI Voice Assistants Change the Game

An AI Voice Assistant isn't a voicemail. It answers the phone instantly, 24/7, with a human voice. It can:
1.  **Qualify the Lead**: "Is this for a residential or commercial property?"
2.  **Check Your Schedule**: It sees your calendar in real-time.
3.  **Book the Estimate**: "I have an opening tomorrow at 2 PM. Does that work?"

## Case Study: The HVAC Contractor

We worked with a local HVAC company missing 30% of calls during peak summer heat. By deploying an Eliana AI agent:
*   **0% Missed Calls**: Every caller spoke to an "agent".
*   **Significant New Revenue**: In the first month, from after-hours emergency calls alone.
*   **Better Sleep**: The owner stopped taking the phone to dinner.

Stop letting your competitors take your customers just because they answered the phone.
