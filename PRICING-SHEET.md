## The 4 Verticals

The audit sorts every client into one of 4 buckets. The vertical changes the language, not the pricing math.

| Vertical | Who Falls Here | Words to Use |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Online** | Course creators, coaches, memberships, SaaS, digital products, newsletters, cohorts | Offers, launches, funnels, list, churn, content |
| **Local** | Home services, healthcare, construction, restaurants | Jobs, leads, estimates, technicians, service calls |
| **Professional** | Agencies, professional services, real estate | Clients, retainers, proposals, engagements, pipeline |
| **Product** | Ecommerce, manufacturing | Orders, SKUs, fulfillment, AOV, returns, inventory |

---

## The 5 Audit Scores

| Category | What It Measures | Key Inputs | Low Score Means |
|----------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Revenue** | Financial health + growth direction | Revenue stage, trend, profit margin | Flat/declining revenue, thin margins |
| **Automation** | How much runs without the owner | % automated, tool count, onboarding automated? | Almost nothing automated, tools disconnected |
| **Acquisition** | How they get new customers | Conversion rate, list size, traffic source | Low conversion, small audience, single source |
| **Retention** | How well they keep customers | Churn/refund rate, price point, recurring? | High churn, lots of refunds, no recurring |
| **Time** | Owner freedom and leverage | Take 2 weeks off?, hours/week, % high-value work | Owner trapped, 60+ hours, low-value tasks |

Overall score = average of all 5.

## Reading Intent Signals (Step 7 of Form)

| Signal | Hot | Warm | Cold |
|--------|-----|------|------|
| **Excitement** | 8-10 | 5-7 | Under 5 |
| **Pain Level** | 7+ | 4-6 | Under 4 |
| **Timeline** | Right now / This month | Next quarter | Just exploring |
| **Budget Comfort** | $15K-$40K / $40K+ | $5K-$15K | Under $5K |

| Intent Level | Trigger | Your Move |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **HIGH** | Excitement 8+ OR Pain 7+ | Move fast. Propose within 24 hours. |
| **MEDIUM** | Excitement 5-7, pain under 7 | Nurture first. Strategy call, then propose. |
| **LOW** | Everything else | Free advice. Add to email list. Follow up in 30 days. |

## The 3 Tiers

| Tier | Price Range | What They Get | Best For |
|------|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Multi-System Build** | $7,500 – $15,000 | 3-5 connected systems. CRM, pipeline, follow-up, booking, basic automations. Training + 30-day support. | Mid-level scores. Need core systems. Revenue $100K-$1M. |
| **Full Build** | $15,000 – $40,000 | End-to-end automation. AI agents. Marketing overhaul. Operations rebuild. SOPs. Team training. 90-day support. | Low scores. Owner burned out. Revenue $500K+. Pain 7+. |

## The 6-Step Pricing Algorithm

### Step 1: Check the Floor (Qualify / Disqualify)

| If This Is True... | Then Do This |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Revenue is pre-revenue or under $100K | Disqualify. Too early for us. Give free advice. |
| Budget "Under $5K" AND pain under 5 AND excitement under 5 | Disqualify. Not ready. Nurture with content. |
| Budget "Under $5K" BUT pain 7+ | Reframe. Show the money math. May convert. |
| Decision maker = "Researching for someone else" | Get to the real decision maker before proposing. |
| Everything else | Move to Step 2. |

### Step 2: Pick the Starting Tier

| Overall Score | Starting Tier | Starting Price |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| 60-100 | Multi-System Build | $7,500 |
| 35-59 | Full Build | $15,000 |
| Under 35 | Full Build or AI-Native | $20,000+ |

### Step 3: Apply Override Rules (These Always Win)

| Override Condition | Minimum Tier |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Hours 60+ AND can't take 2 weeks off AND under 20% high-value work | Full Build |
| Automation under 30% AND no onboarding AND fewer than 3 tools | Multi-System (min) |
| Revenue $1M+ or $3M+ | Full Build (min) |
| Pain 8+ AND "Right now" timeline AND excitement 8+ | Full Build (min) |
| Budget comfort "$40K+" AND revenue $1M+ | AI-Native Ops |

### Step 4: Add Complexity

Start with the base price from Step 2. Then add:

| Complexity Factor | Add This | Applies To |
|------------------|----------|-----------|
| All 5 scores under 50 | +15% of base | Full Build, AI-Native |
| Team size 10+ | +10% of base | All tiers |
| Custom integrations needed | +$2,000 – $5,000 | All tiers |
| AI agent or chatbot in scope | +$2,500 – $5,000 | Full Build, AI-Native |
| Multi-location (2+ locations) | +$2,000 per extra | All tiers |
| Rush delivery (half timeline) | +25% of base | All tiers |
| Ongoing monthly retainer | +$1,500 – $5,000/mo | All tiers |

### Step 5: Check the ROI Ceiling

**The price should never exceed 30% of projected first-year gain.**

1. Look at current revenue (from Step 3 of form)
2. Estimate conservative improvement (15-30% of current revenue)
3. Multiply that gain by 0.30 = your price ceiling

Example: $500K revenue x 20% improvement = $100K gain. Ceiling = $100K x 0.30 = $30,000.

If price is over the ceiling: lower it OR break into phases so Phase 1 is under the ceiling.

### Step 6: Apply Discounts (Optional)

| Discount | Amount Off |
|----------|-----------|
| Pays in full upfront | 5-10% |
| Referred by existing client | 5% |
| Signs within 48 hours | 5% |
| PE portfolio / partner network | 10% |

**Max total discount: 15%.** Never stack beyond that.
**Hard floor: Even after discounts, price never drops below $7,500.**

## Full Example: Online Coach

**Client:** Online business coach. $2K group program + $5K 1-on-1. Revenue ~$300K, flat. 3 people. 55 hrs/wk. Almost nothing automated. Pain 8. Excitement 9. Timeline: Right now. Budget: $5K-$15K.

| Scores | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue | 55 |
| Automation | 20 |
| Acquisition | 45 |
| Retention | 60 |
| Time | 30 |
| **Overall** | **42** |

**Step 1:** Revenue $300K. Pain 8. Not disqualified.
**Step 2:** Score 42 (35-59 range) → Full Build → $15,000.
**Step 3:** Pain 8+ AND "Right now" AND excitement 9 → override confirms Full Build minimum. Already there.
**Step 4:** No complexity add-ons needed. $15,000 stays.
**Step 5:** Revenue $300K x 20% = $60K gain. Ceiling = $60K x 0.30 = $18,000. Price $15K is under ceiling.
**Step 6:** 5% off for signing within 48 hours = $750 off. **Final: $14,250.**

ROI pitch: For every $1 they spend, ~$4 back in year one (conservative).
