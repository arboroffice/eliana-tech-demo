    questions: [
      { q: "What is Elianatech?", a: "We build smart systems that help your business run better. Think of us as the team that sets up robots to handle your boring tasks so you can focus on the fun stuff." },
      { q: "Who do you help?", a: "Business owners who are tired of doing the same tasks over and over. If you spend hours on emails, follow-ups, or keeping track of leads, we can help." },
      { q: "How are you different from a regular marketing agency?", a: "Marketing agencies make ads and posts. We build the systems behind your business. We set up the pipes that move water - not just turn on the faucet." },
      { q: "What is 'Growth Infrastructure'?", a: "It's like the roads and bridges for your business. You can have the best car (product), but without roads (infrastructure), you can't go anywhere. We build those roads." },
      { q: "Do you do the work for me?", a: "Yes! We don't just teach you - we build everything for you. Then we show you how it works." },
      { q: "How long does it take to set everything up?", a: "Most builds take 2-4 weeks. Bigger projects can take 6-8 weeks. We'll give you a clear timeline before we start." },
      { q: "Is Elianatech a software I buy?", a: "No. We're a team that builds custom systems for your business. Every business is different, so every system we build is different." },
      { q: "What types of businesses do you work with?", a: "All kinds! Home services, coaches, agencies, local shops, online stores, and more. If you sell something, we can help you sell more." },
      { q: "Can I see examples of your work?", a: "Yes! We have case studies that show real results. Just ask and we'll share ones that fit your industry." },
      { q: "What happens in the first call?", a: "We listen. You tell us what's not working, and we figure out if we can help. No pressure, no tricks - just a real talk about your business." }

  {
    category: "The Deep Audit",
    questions: [
      { q: "What is the Deep Audit?", a: "It's like a doctor's checkup for your business. We look at everything - your leads, your follow-ups, your sales process - and find where you're losing money." },
      { q: "Why do I need an audit first?", a: "You wouldn't ask a doctor to do surgery before they check what's wrong. The audit tells us exactly what to fix so we don't waste your time or money." },
      { q: "How long does the audit take?", a: "About 3-5 business days after we get all your info." },
      { q: "What do I get when it's done?", a: "A full report that shows: Where you're losing leads, How much money you could be making, A step-by-step plan to fix it, and Exact numbers on what's possible." },
      { q: "Do I have to buy anything after the audit?", a: "No. The audit is valuable on its own. You could take it and fix things yourself. But most people want us to do the work." },
      { q: "What info do you need from me?", a: "Access to your current tools (CRM, email, website stats) and 30 minutes of your time to answer questions." },
      { q: "How do we get started?", a: "The process begins with an initial evaluation where we map out your workflows and identify the highest-impact areas for automation." },
      { q: "What if the audit shows I don't need AI?", a: "We'll tell you! If AI isn't the answer, we'll point you to what will actually help. We don't sell things people don't need." },
      { q: "What is 'Lead Leakage'?", a: "It's money dripping out of your bucket. Every lead that comes in but doesn't buy is leakage. We find where the holes are." },
      { q: "What is 'Recoverable Revenue'?", a: "Money you should be making but aren't. Maybe leads are falling through cracks. Maybe follow-ups aren't happening. We calculate exactly how much you're leaving on the table." },
      { q: "Is the audit helpful for small teams?", a: "Absolutely! Smaller teams often have the most to gain because every lead matters more." },
      { q: "Will the audit mess up how things work now?", a: "No. We just look and take notes. We don't touch anything until you say go." }

  {
    category: "AI Agents",
    questions: [
      { q: "What are AI agents?", a: "Think of them as robot helpers that can talk to your customers, answer questions, book appointments, and follow up - all without you doing anything." },
      { q: "Are these just chatbots?", a: "No. Chatbots follow scripts. Our agents think. They understand what people mean, not just what they say." },
      { q: "Do they sound like robots?", a: "No! We train them to talk like real people. Most customers can't tell the difference." },
      { q: "Can they answer phone calls?", a: "Yes. Our voice agents can pick up calls, answer questions, and even book appointments - 24/7." },
      { q: "Where do the agents work?", a: "Wherever your customers are: your website, text messages, email, Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and phone calls." },
      { q: "What if the AI says something wrong?", a: "We build guardrails. The AI only talks about what we train it on. It won't make stuff up or go off-script on important things." },
      { q: "Can I see what the AI is saying?", a: "Yes. You get a dashboard where you can read every conversation." },
      { q: "What if someone needs to talk to a real person?", a: "The AI knows when to hand off. If someone is upset or has a tricky question, it brings in a human right away." },
      { q: "Do the agents get smarter over time?", a: "Yes. We review conversations and make them better. They learn from real interactions." },
      { q: "What languages do they speak?", a: "As many as you need. Most common: English, Spanish, French, and more." },
      { q: "Are they available 24/7?", a: "Yes. That's the whole point. Your business never sleeps." },
      { q: "Can they book appointments?", a: "Yes. They check your calendar and book people right into open slots." },
      { q: "Do I have to manage them?", a: "No. We handle the tech stuff. You just watch the leads roll in." },
      { q: "Can they take payments?", a: "Yes. We can connect them to your payment system so people can pay right in the chat." },
      { q: "What's the difference between a 'bot' and an 'agent'?", a: "A bot follows rules (if this, then that). An agent thinks and makes decisions like a person would." },
      { q: "Can agents look at my business data?", a: "Yes. They can pull up customer info, order history, and more to give personalized answers." },
      { q: "Can the AI remember past conversations?", a: "Yes. If a customer talked to the agent last week, it remembers and picks up where you left off." },
      { q: "What happens if the AI makes a mistake?", a: "We have alerts. If something goes wrong, we catch it fast and fix it. Plus, you can always override any conversation." }

    category: "Growth Infrastructure",
    questions: [
      { q: "What does setting up a CRM look like?", a: "We don't just install software. We build it around how YOU work. Every stage, every tag, every automation - custom for your business." },
      { q: "Can you connect to tools I already use?", a: "Yes. We play nice with most software. If you love a tool, we'll make it part of the system." },
      { q: "What is an 'Automated Sales Pipeline'?", a: "It's like a conveyor belt for leads. Someone fills out a form, and the system automatically texts them, sends emails, reminds you to call, and tracks everything - without you lifting a finger." },
      { q: "How do you track where leads come from?", a: "We set up tracking so you know: this lead came from Facebook, this one from Google, this one from a referral. You'll know what's working and what's not." },
      { q: "What is 'Lead Scoring'?", a: "A way to rank leads by how likely they are to buy. Hot leads get attention first. Cold leads get nurtured until they're ready." },
      { q: "Do you build dashboards?", a: "Yes. Real-time dashboards that show your numbers at a glance. No more digging through spreadsheets." },
      { q: "What is 'Systematized Follow-up'?", a: "Most businesses lose leads because they forget to follow up. We build systems that never forget. The right message, at the right time, every time." },
      { q: "Can you move my data from my old system?", a: "Yes. We handle data migration carefully. Nothing gets lost." },
      { q: "What is 'Yield Optimization'?", a: "Systems that optimize your revenue based on demand, season, and customer behavior—maximizing profit without manual intervention." },
      { q: "Will you train my team?", a: "Yes. We make videos, guides, and do live training so everyone knows how to use the new systems." },
      { q: "What if something breaks?", a: "We build things solid, but stuff happens. We include support so you're never stuck." },
      { q: "Can these systems grow with my business?", a: "Absolutely. We build for where you're going, not just where you are." },
      { q: "What is a 'Content Engine'?", a: "A system that creates, schedules, and posts content for you. With AI, it can even write drafts based on your voice." },
      { q: "Do you build apps?", a: "We focus on web apps and internal tools. If you need a mobile app, we can point you to the right people." },
      { q: "What is 'Omnichannel Automation'?", a: "Reaching people everywhere - email, text, social, phone - all working together as one system. No leads fall through= cracks." },
      { q: "Can you create documents automatically?", a: "Yes. Contracts, proposals, invoices - all generated and sent without you typing a thing." },
      { q: "What about booking and scheduling?", a: "We can automate your whole calendar. Customers book themselves, get reminders, and show up - all on autopilot." },
      { q: "Can you set up email marketing?", a: "Yes. We build email sequences that nurture leads, onboard customers, and bring back people who haven't bought in a while." }

    category: "Technical & Security",
    questions: [
      { q: "What AI technology do you use?", a: "The best tools for the job. We use OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), and others depending on what works best for your use case." },
      { q: "What other tech do you use?", a: "Popular tools like GoHighLevel, Make, Zapier, n8n, Voiceflow, Vapi, and custom code when needed." },
      { q: "Do you use simple tools or complex code?", a: "Both. We use no-code tools when they work. We write code when we need more power. The goal is: what works best for you." },
      { q: "Who pays for the AI usage?", a: "We'll explain all costs upfront. Some tools have monthly fees. We help you pick the most cost-effective options." },
      { q: "Does the AI run on my servers?", a: "Usually no. Most AI runs in the cloud. But if you need on-premise for security, we can do that too." },
      { q: "Can you build this under my brand?", a: "Yes. White-labeling is available for agencies and businesses that want to offer AI to their clients." },
      { q: "Is my data safe?", a: "Yes. We follow best practices for security. If you're in healthcare or finance, we know the rules (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)." },
      { q: "What is 'RAG'?", a: "It stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. In simple terms: the AI looks up real info from YOUR business before answering. No guessing." },
      { q: "How long is your warranty?", a: "30 days after launch. If something breaks because of our work, we fix it free." },
      { q: "Can I update what the AI knows?", a: "Yes. We build systems so you can add new info, update answers, and keep things fresh." },
      { q: "How do you test the AI before launching?", a: "We run it through hundreds of test conversations. We try to break it. Only when it's solid do we go live." },
      { q: "What is 'Human-in-the-loop'?", a: "A setup where humans can jump in when needed. The AI handles 90%+, but a person can take over anytime." },
      { q: "Can you work with my old software?", a: "Usually yes. We've connected to some pretty ancient systems. If there's a way in, we'll find it." },
      { q: "What about industry-specific tools?", a: "We've worked with software for dental, HVAC, law, real estate, and more. If it has an API, we can probably connect to it." },
      { q: "What is 'Agentic Orchestration'?", a: "Multiple AI agents working together. One handles calls, another does follow-ups, another books appointments - all talking to each other." },
      { q: "How do you make sure the AI sounds like my brand?", a: "We study how you talk. Your tone, your words, your vibe. Then we train the AI to match." }

    category: "Common Concerns",
    questions: [
      { q: "I'm not tech-savvy. Will this be too complicated?", a: "No. We handle all the tech. You just need to know your business. We'll explain everything in plain English." },
      { q: "What if this doesn't work for my industry?", a: "We've worked with 100+ industries. If there's a reason it won't work, we'll tell you in the audit - before you spend money on a build." },
      { q: "I've been burned by agencies before. Why is this different?", a: "We build things you own. We show you results before asking for more money. And we're not here to lock you into endless contracts." },
      { q: "My business is unique. Can you handle that?", a: "Unique is what we do. Cookie-cutter solutions don't work. Everything we build is custom to your situation." },
      { q: "What if I want to change things later?", a: "You own the systems. Change whatever you want. Or hire us to make updates - your choice." },
      { q: "I don't have time for a big project right now.", a: "That's exactly why you need systems. We do the heavy lifting. Your time commitment is a few hours total." },
      { q: "What if my team resists the new systems?", a: "We've seen it before. We build things that make their jobs easier, not harder. And we train them so they feel confident." },
      { q: "Is AI going to replace my employees?", a: "No. AI handles the repetitive stuff so your people can do the meaningful work. It's a tool, not a replacement." },
      { q: "I'm worried about AI sounding fake to my customers.", a: "Valid concern. Our agents are trained on YOUR voice and your industry. Most customers can't tell they're talking to AI." },
      { q: "What if I want to pause or stop using the systems?", a: "You can. You own everything. Turn it off, change it, or hand it to someone else anytime." }

      { q: "What information do you need from me for the audit?", a: "We'll need access to your current CRM, sales process data, and a few interviews with your key team members to understand manual workflows." },
      { q: "How do we get started?", a: "The process begins with an evaluation of your current systems to determine the best path forward. Contact us to schedule a strategy session." },
